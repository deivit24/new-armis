        <h1>It's all about diversification</h1>
        <h4>While there is no such thing as a free lunch, risk reduction through diversification is as close as it
          gets.</h4>


        <p> <strong>Diversification</strong> is about buying a basket of securities that tend to do well (or poorly) at
          different
          times
          and under different economic conditions. Being thoughtful about how much capital to allocate to each of
          these securities can result in far more consistent returns than concentrating all capital (and risk) in a
          single security or asset class. These portfolios are diversified across multiple asset classes, including
          stocks, bonds, and inflation-hedging securities like Real Estate Investment Trusts. The capital
          allocation
          to each of these asset classes is dialed up or down depending on the desired risk level. When these asset
          classes are combined together intelligently in a portfolio they can provide income, growth, and stability
          during different economic conditions.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, it is well accepted in the industry that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stocks do well in periods of growth;</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Bonds provide stability and income during periods of market downturns; and</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Real Estate and Inflation-Protection Bonds do well during inflationary periods.</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div id="alloca" class="block">
        <h1>Our Allocation</h1>
        <h4>A Nobel Prize Winning Approach</h4>
        <p>Our portfolios allocate capital to an equity component, a bond component and an inflation-hedging component.
          Together these deliver good diversification, which leads to risk reduction and return stability.</p>
        <p>The capital allocation to each of these asset classes is dialed up or down depending on the targeted risk
          level. Clients fill out a risk questionnaire, and receive a recommended portfolio based on their responses to
          that risk.

        </p>

        <p id="pass">Armis Financial's approach to portfolio construction is influenced by the work of Nobel Prize
          laureates
          William Sharpe and Harry Markowitz, who shaped the role of financial science in investing through their
          development of Modern Portfolio Theory. This theory states that a portfolio diversified across asset classes
          offers the best opportunity for an investor to achieve the highest possible return for a given level of risk.
          It suggests that your portfolio should be diversified with REITs, international equities, emerging market
          equities, US equities, and fixed income. Our portfolios own around 12,000 stocks in over 40 countries as well
          as bonds that are selected based upon each customer's unique situation.

        <h1>Passive Investing</h1>
        <img id="pass-image" src="../img/pass.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <p>What is passive investing? We first must define active investing. Active investing is paying someone to pick
          investments for you—such as stocks, bonds, or any other kind of investment. It involves paying not only this
          person and his or her team — in this case a mutual fund manager — to pick these investments, but paying for
          lots of expensive trading when the manager decides to buy and sell things. The perception behind active
          investing is that these people are smarter than the market as a whole, and that will make it worth the extra
          cost for paying the manager and the extra trading. Although this might sound great at first, mutual fund
          managers are bound by regulatory laws and job complacency incentives to not always go with their best ideas.
          <a href="#no-mf">Learn more</a> to find out what I mean by that.</p>

        <p>
          Passive investing is different (in a good way). Passive investing runs on the principle that individuals are
          actually very bad at picking winners when it comes to stocks, bonds or other investments (which an abundant
          amount of research proves), passive investments track entire swathes of different markets. Whether those
          swathes happen to be all the companies that make up the S&P 500 —or stocks from one part of the world,
          certain types of bonds, real estate, or what have you. Instead of trying to pick winners, you diversify. The
          costs of diversifying in passive investments are a fraction of the costs of active investments (Mutual
          Funds).
        </p>
        <img id="buffet-image" src="../img/buffet.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Warren Buffet, arguably the most successful investor in the world, made a bet about a decade ago that a
          passive S&P 500 index fund would outperform a hedge fund. He won handily. he final results were a 7.1%
          annualized gain for the S&P 500 index fund (about 99% overall return) versus just 2.2% annualized (about 24%
          total) for the basket of funds Ted Seides (the hedge fund manager whom he made a bet against) had selected.
          Although Buffet has made an enormous fortune and built a reputation for picking winning investments, why did
          Warren Buffet bet on Passive Investing? And why is he willing to bet on it again?</p>
        <p>First and foremost, selling out of all your stocks and buying passive index investments is not what Buffet
          is suggesting. He has nothing against stock picking if you have knowledge, desire, time and discipline.
          However, most individuals don’t, which for that very reason makes passive index investing the best investment
          for most individuals. Buffet has a problem with actively managed funds (Hedge and Mutual funds), due to their
          high fees. Some fund managers will beat the market some years and some will lose. And since they all charge
          higher fees, investors are at an inherent disadvantage, particularly over investors with a long-time horizon.

        <h1 id="no-mf">Mutual Funds</h1>
        <h4>And what you should know about them</h4>
        <h2>4 Questions to ask yourself:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Do you own any Mutual Funds in your 401k, IRA, 403b, brokerage account, etc.?

          </li>
          <li>Are your Mutual Funds underperforming or overperforming?

          </li>
          <li>Do you understand the fees associated with Mutual Funds?

          </li>
          <li>Where can I learn more about the fees in my Mutual Funds?

          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>For the longest time, Mutual Funds have been touted to be one the best investments for individual investors.
          That is why most portfolios, whether its in a 401k, 403b, IRA, etc., are investment in Mutual Funds. But are
          they really the best solution for the individual investor?

        </p>
        <p>You may believe you are holding the top rated Mutual Funds by Morningstar but in reality, 88% of those
          5-star funds were underperformers in the long-run. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-morningstar-mirage-1508946687"

      <h1>3 Types Of Fees Behind Mutual Funds
      </h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 block2">

          <h3><strong>Ongoing Basis - </strong></h3>
          <p>These are the type of fees that Mutual Funds might charge on an
            ongoing basis:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Management fees -</strong> These are the fees you pay to the manager/managers of the fund.</li>
            <li><strong>12b-1 fees -</strong> These fees, capped at 1% of your assets in the fund annually, are taken
              out of the fund's assets to pay for the cost of marketing and selling the fund, for some shareholder
              services, and sometimes to pay employee bonuses.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Expenses -</strong> This miscellaneous category includes the costs of providing services
              to shareholders outside of the expenses covered by 12b-1 fees or portfolio management fees. You also pay
              transaction fees for the trades the fund makes, though this amount is not reported separately as the
              other fees are.</li>
          </ul>


        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 block3 ">
          <h3><strong>Specific Action -</strong></h3>
          <p>These are the type of fees that Mutual Funds might charge based on a an action:

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Account fees - </strong> Funds may charge you a separate fee to maintain your account,
              especially
              if your investment falls below a set dollar amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Redemption fees - </strong>To discourage very short-term trading, funds often charge a
              redemption
              fee to investors who sell shares shortly after buying them. Redemption fees may be charged anywhere from
              a few days to over a year.</li>
            <li><strong>Exchange fees - </strong>Some funds also charge exchange fees for moving your money from one
              fund
              to another fund offered by the same investment company.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Purchase fees - </strong>Whether or not a fund charges a front-end sales charge, it may assess
              a
              purchase fee at the time you buy shares of the fund.</li>
          </ul>
